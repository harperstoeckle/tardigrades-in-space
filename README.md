# Tardigrades in Space
This game uses an extremely basic terminal-based 3D software renderer. It was
originally created for the IB group 4 project.

## Building
Currently, this only works on Windows and requires curses. At the time that I
created it, I didn't feel the need to use any sort of build system, so some
dubious build commands are provided in comments at the bottom of
`game_main.cpp`.
